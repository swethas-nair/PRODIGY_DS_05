Project Title : Road Accident Analysis

Project Description:

* The purpose of this Power BI dashboard is to analyze road accident data and identify patterns and trends that can help improve road safety. 

* The data includes information about accidents, such as the number of vehicles involved, severity of the accident,Road surface Condition, weather conditions etc.

* Through the analysis, we seek to gain valuable insights and give a visual form of insight that can inform effective strategies for enhancing road safety and reducing the frequency and severity of accidents.

Steps involved:

-> Extracting the data from Kaggle.

-> Imported the data into Power BI and cleaned it to ensure it was accurate and ready for analysis.

-> Transforming the data in Power Query in Power BI.

-> Loading it in the Power BI and creating dashboard using various charts and DAX queries.

Project Deliverables:

An interactive powerBI dashboard providing comprehensive insights into road accidents.

Conclusion:

The project aims to utilise the capabilities of powerbi to transform a raw dataset into meaningful insights.
